TrueDialog Ruby SDK

Edit ./examples/config.yml to add your TrueDialog credentials.

If you would like to build the gem file, execute "rake build" 
from the main directory.  To install globally, execute "rake install" 
after the build.

Otherwise, navigate to the ./examples/ directory to run individual 
*.rb files.
